# Facial_Recognition_Model
A high-performance facial recognition model built using deep learning techniques for real-time face detection, encoding, and identification. This project leverages state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract high dimensional facial embeddings and match them against a known database with high accuracy.
