# Facial Recognition Model

A powerful and modular deep learning-based facial recognition system for real-time detection, encoding, and identification of human faces. Built with cutting-edge computer vision and neural network techniques, this project is designed for both research and production use-cases including security, attendance tracking, and human-computer interaction.

## Features

- High-accuracy facial **detection** using MTCNN or RetinaFace  
- Facial **embedding/encoding** with models like FaceNet or ArcFace  
- Robust **identification & verification** via vector similarity metrics  
- Real-time webcam/video stream support (OpenCV)  
- Optional **API endpoint** via Flask or FastAPI  
- Optional **liveness detection** to prevent spoofing  
- ROC curve, accuracy, F1-score evaluation  
- Easily extensible with your own dataset  
- GPU acceleration with CUDA / Apple M1 support

## Installation
1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anipaleja/Facial_Recognition_Model.git
cd Facial_Recognition_Model
```

2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or with conda:

```bash
conda create -n facereco python=3.8
conda activate facereco
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download Pretrained Models
Place your pretrained models (e.g. FaceNet, ArcFace .pth or .pb files) in the /models directory. You can use:

- [FaceNet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet)

- [InsightFace](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface)

## Usage
Run Real-Time Recognition (Webcam):

```bash
python recognize.py --source webcam
```

Recognize From a Video File:
```bash
python recognize.py --source "input_video.mp4"
```
Add New Face to Database:
```bash
python add_face.py --name "Anish"
```

Launch the API (Optional):
```bash
cd api
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

## Evaluation
You can evaluate model performance using ROC curve and classification metrics:

```bash
python evaluate.py --test-data test_dataset/
```
